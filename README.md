# HardRightEdge

HardRightEdge is a Windows desktop application (there are plans to change this to a web based application), written in F#, that allows you to manage your stock portfolio and data from Yahoo! Finance and Google Finance.

It does not aim to provide any front end analytics tools, but rather makes sure that your data is stored in a neat Sqlite database. HardRightEdge serves as a utility tool to help you manage financial data sources for analytics tools like R statistics.
