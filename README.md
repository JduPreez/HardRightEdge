# HardRightEdge

HardRightEdge is a Windows desktop application (there are plans to change this to Electron), written in F#, that allows you to manage your stock portfolio and data from Yahoo! Finance & Google Finance.

It does not aim to provide any front end analytics tools, but rather makes sure that your data is stored in a neat Sqlite database. HardRightEdge serves as a utility tool to help you manage financial data sources for analytics tools like R statistics.
